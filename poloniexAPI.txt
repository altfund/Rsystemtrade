Public API Methods
Please note that making more than 6 calls per second to the public API, or repeatedly and needlessly fetching excessive amounts of data, can result in your IP being banned.

There are six public methods, all of which take HTTP GET requests and return output in JSON format:

return24Volume
Returns the 24-hour volume for all markets, plus totals for primary currencies. Sample output:
  
{"BTC_LTC":{"BTC":"2.23248854","LTC":"87.10381314"},"BTC_NXT":{"BTC":"0.981616","NXT":"14145"}, ... "totalBTC":"81.89657704","totalLTC":"78.52083806"}

Trading API Methods
To use the trading API, you will need to create an API key.

Please note that there is a default limit of 6 calls per second. If you require more than this, please consider optimizing your application using the push API, the "moveOrder" command, or the "all" parameter where appropriate. If this is still insufficient, please contact support to discuss a limit raise.

All calls to the trading API are sent via HTTP POST to https://poloniex.com/tradingApi and must contain the following headers:
  
  Key - Your API key.
Sign - The query's POST data signed by your key's "secret" according to the HMAC-SHA512 method.
Additionally, all queries must include a "nonce" POST parameter. The nonce parameter is an integer which must always be greater than the previous nonce used.

All responses from the trading API are in JSON format. In the event of an error, the response will always be of the following format:
  
{"error":"<error message>"}

There are several methods accepted by the trading API, each of which is specified by the "command" POST parameter:


  
  returnDepositAddresses
  Returns all of your deposit addresses. Sample output:
  
  {"BTC":"19YqztHmspv2egyD6jQM3yn81x5t5krVdJ","LTC":"LPgf9kjv9H1Vuh4XSaKhzBe8JHdou1WgUB", ... "ITC":"Press Generate.." ... }
  
  generateNewAddress
  Generates a new deposit address for the currency specified by the "currency" POST parameter. Sample output:
  
  {"success":1,"response":"CKXbbs8FAVbtEa397gJHSutmrdrBrhUMxe"}
  
  Only one address per currency per day may be generated, and a new address may not be generated before the previously-generated one has been used.
  
  returnDepositsWithdrawals
  Returns your deposit and withdrawal history within a range, specified by the "start" and "end" POST parameters, both of which should be given as UNIX timestamps. Sample output:
  
  {"deposits":
  [{"currency":"BTC","address":"...","amount":"0.01006132","confirmations":10,
  "txid":"17f819a91369a9ff6c4a34216d434597cfc1b4a3d0489b46bd6f924137a47701","timestamp":1399305798,"status":"COMPLETE"},{"currency":"BTC","address":"...","amount":"0.00404104","confirmations":10,

  withdraw
  Immediately places a withdrawal for a given currency, with no email confirmation. In order to use this method, the withdrawal privilege must be enabled for your API key.

  {"response":"Withdrew 2398 NXT."}
  
  returnFeeInfo
  If you are enrolled in the maker-taker fee schedule, returns your current trading fees and trailing 30-day volume in BTC. This information is updated once every 24 hours.
