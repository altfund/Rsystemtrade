AlephNull
=======
AlephNull is a python module for the development
and execution of algorithmic trading strategies.
The library is being developed under commission
by [Carter Bain](http://www.carterbain.com). 

The module is built on top of the [Zipline library](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline), 
the backbone of the web-based backtesting
platform [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com) 

The aim of the module is to extend the features
of Zipline, for use within an institutional framework. 
We hope to use the module to standardize research across 
our trade desk and support live execution across all 
asset classes for our clients.
